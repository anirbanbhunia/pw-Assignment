1.What is padding and margin and when do you use them?
ans: a.Padding - The inner space between the content and the border of your box.
     b.Margin - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.

     In general, use margins when we’re adjusting the spacing of an element in relation to another element (i.e a div in relation to another div on the page), and padding when you’re adjusting the look of an individual element (i.e the amount of pixels between the edge of a div and the text within it).

2.What is display property and explain display inline, block, and inlineblock?
ans:The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an
element.
 
 display inline:Displays an element as an inline element (like <span>). Any height and width properties will have no effect.

display block:Displays an element as a block element (like <p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width.

display inline-block:Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values.

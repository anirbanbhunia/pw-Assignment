ans: Block elements : A block element always begins on a new line and browser add a mergine before and after by default.

ex: <p></p>, <div></div>, <h1></h1> etc.

     Inline elemens : Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.

a block elemen always occupies the entire available width(streaches out to the left and right as far as possible).

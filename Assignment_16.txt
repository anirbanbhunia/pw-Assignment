1.What is the grid?
ans:An intersection of vertical and horizontal lines is known as a grid.
  Major sections of a page are separated using CSS Grid layout.

  A grid-based layout system with rows and columns is provided by the grid
attribute. It eliminates the need for positioning and floating, making web page
creation simple.

  The grid layout enables us to construct grid structures represented in CSS rather
than HTML.

  The user can align the pieces into rows and columns like a table. But using the
CSS grid to construct a layout is simpler than using tables.

2.What is the difference between Flex and grid?
ans:The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.

3.How can you define rows and columns for your grid?
ans:We define rows and columns on our grid with the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties.

4.List any two properties of the grid item and grid container?
ans:Properties of grid container:-
    a.grid-template-columns & grid-template-rows:-Determine the size of columns and rows within a grid container and these properties can take a list of space-separated values e.g. tack-size, line-name.
    b.row-gap & column-gap:-These properties determine the gap between the grid rows and grid columns respectively.

    Properties of grid item:-
    a.grid-column-start:- An item property that sets the element's start position within the grid column.
    b.grid-column-end:- An item property that sets the element's end position within the grid column.

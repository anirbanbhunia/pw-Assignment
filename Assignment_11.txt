1.Why CSS selectors are used in HTML?
ans: CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

2.What are the different types of Selectors in CSS?
ans:We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

i.Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
ii.Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
iii.Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
iv.Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
v.Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

3.How do you include external fonts and apply them?
ans:To change font type purely with HTML, use the CSS font-family property. Set it to the value you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a paragraph, heading, button, or span tag.

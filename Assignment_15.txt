3.What is Z-indx and why to use it?
ans:The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of elements on a webpage, particularly in relation to overlapping elements.
In other words, if two or more HTML elements overlap each other, the element with a higher z-index value will appear on top of the element(s) with lower z-index values.
